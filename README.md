# README for sc-miReg

This Github repository stores files for **Analysis of miRNA Regulation in Single Cells**, maintained by Wendao Liu([liuwd15@tsinghua.org.cn](liuwd15@tsinghua.org.cn)).

The analysis workflow, along with all results, are shown in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/liuwd15/sc-miReg/blob/master/microRNA%20regulation%20in%20single%20cells.ipynb). **Please view this notebook first.**

If you want to run the workflow on your own device, we provide a [R script](https://github.com/liuwd15/sc-miReg/blob/master/microRNA%20regulation%20in%20single%20cells.R) that can be run in any R console.

Data files are available in the [data directory](https://github.com/liuwd15/sc-miReg/tree/master/data).
